## Common Git Commands Reference

```bash
# Repository Setup
git clone <url>          # Clone a repository
git init                 # Initialize a new repository

# Basic Commands
git status              # Check repository status
git add <file>          # Stage changes
git commit -m "message" # Commit changes
git push                # Push changes to remote
git pull                # Pull changes from remote

# Branching
git branch              # List branches
git checkout <branch>   # Switch branches
git checkout -b <name>  # Create and switch to new branch
git merge <branch>      # Merge branches

# History
git log                 # View commit history
git diff                # View changes
```

## Troubleshooting Tips
- If you make a mistake in your last commit message:
  ```bash
  git commit --amend -m "New message"
  ```
- If you need to undo staged changes:
  ```bash
  git reset HEAD <file>
  ```
- If you need to discard local changes:
  ```bash
  git checkout -- <file>
  ```

## Extra Challenges
1. Try creating multiple branches and merging them
2. Practice resolving merge conflicts
3. Experiment with `git revert` to undo commits
4. Create a `.gitignore` file and test it

## Need Help?
If you get stuck, try these steps:
1. Check `git status` to see what's happening
2. Look at the error message carefully
3. Ask a workshop mentor for help
4. Google the error message (a very real developer skill!)
